            Coach Mark Daigneault said Friday that Hayward (calf) won't suit up

            Hayward hasn't suited up since late December and will require a few
            more weeks before he's able to make his debut for his new team.
            However, Daigneault said that the Thunder were aware of the
            33-year-old's return timetable when they traded for him, and Hayward
            will go through Oklahoma City's return to play protocols and
            integrate into the team while he continues to recover.

            Hayward hasn't played since Dec. 26 due to a left calf strain but is
            progressing toward a return. The veteran forward is averaging 14.5
            points, 4.7 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 1.1 steals in 31.9 minutes
            across his 25 appearances this season. However, the emergence of
            rookie Brandon Miller has made the 33-year-old expendable to
            Charlotte. Hayward will likely compete for a starting spot with
            Luguentz Dort for a Thunder team with aspirations to make a deep
            playoff run.

            Hayward's ascension to a questionable designation aligns with coach
            Steve Clifford mentioning Monday that a return for the 33-year-old
            is close. Hayward has been mentioned in trade rumors while also
            profiling as a buyout candidate, but there is likely mutual interest
            in exercising an abundance of caution with his health. His status
            will need to be monitored in advance of Wednesday's game.

            Coach Steve Clifford said Monday that Hayward, who hasn't played

            Hayward is amid a two-game absence due to a stomach virus, but he
            appears to be on the mend in advance of Wednesday's contest.
            Charlotte lost to Toronto on Monday while only having 10 active
            players, so Hayward being available would be a boost to the wing
            rotation.

            years -- Hayward hasn't played more than 52 games in a season since

            shooting a career-high 44.4 percent from three-point range, and his
            1.6 steals a night would also be a career high while his 5.1 assists

            manage his hamstring strain. He's appeared in two games since his

            safe. In his absence, more minutes could be available for Kai Jones,

            left knee contusion that will prevent him from playing. It's not yet
            clear when the 32-year-old will be able to return to the court, but
            he'll have four more chances to suit up during the preseason ahead

            Hornets' update all but confirms that assumption, and Hayward will

            Hayward was already dealing with a back injury that forced him to
            miss Sunday's game against the Spurs, and now he may have time to
            recover without having to miss any more game action. Charlotte's
            games this week against Chicago and Denver have been postponed,
            meaning the team's next possible game could come Feb. 20 against the
            Warriors.

            the Celtics, who will receive a massive trade exception equal to
            Hayward's first-year salary with the Hornets. Boston will also trade
            a pair of future second-round picks to Charlotte, which will send a

            team. He should take control of a bigger chunk of the offense than
            he did in Boston, and it's possible we see him return to the kind of
            production that made him an All-Star in Utah during the 2016-17

            Hayward's bruised right knee apparently checked out fine during the
            Celtics' shootaround earlier in the day, so he'll likely reclaim his
            spot in the starting five after a two-game absence. With Jaylen
            Brown (hamstring) sidelined for another contest, Hayward will likely
            rank as the Celtics' third option behind Jaysom Tatum and Kemba
            Walker during his most of his time on the court Sunday.

            Hayward was coming off a four-point effort against the Sixers
            earlier this week, but that performances proved to be an outlier for

            last six games while shooting 50.0 percent from the field and 42.9
            percent from deep during that span. He could get a larger role on
            offense while Kemba Walker (knee) isn't at 100 percent, but even if
            the star point guard returns Wednesday against the Magic, Hayward

            come while Jayson Tatum (groin) has been sidelined for all three
            games, so the former may be a bit of a sell-high player at the
